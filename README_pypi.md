Visit the project's [github page](https://github.com/jajcayn/pygpso).

pyGPSO is python package for Gaussian-Processes Surrogate Optimisation. GPSO is an Bayesian optimisation method designed to cope with costly, high-dimensional, non-convex problems by switching between exploration of the parameter space (using partition tree) and exploitation of the gather knowledge (by training the surrogate function using Gaussian Processes regression).

This is port of original [matlab implementation](https://github.com/jhadida/gpso) by the reference paper author.
